Python Flask is an open-source UI framework created by Armin Ronacher. Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. It is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

MySQL is a popular, free-to-use, and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle. As with other relational systems, MySQL stores data using tables and rows, enforces referential integrity and uses structured query language (SQL) for data access.
