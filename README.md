Python Flask is an open-source UI framework created by Armin Ronacher. Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. It is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file
